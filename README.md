- 👋 Hi, I’m @taethecat (Realer name Tamara) (less-real name Tae)
- 👀 I’m interested in: fixing stuff?
- ✏️ I know: C++(basic, but want to know more)
- 📖 Learning: Windows Powershell

find on this page (when it appears):
- college projects
- game. I'm gonna make stuff for my game idea at some point. I know I won't release the full version here but something like a combat sandbox or partial public beta or something? partial release that lets you mess around with things and determine if any of them are broken but not including the story that will be in the actual game (when I research what lisence I will do that under)
